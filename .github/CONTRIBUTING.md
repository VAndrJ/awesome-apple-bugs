- Submit a separate pull request for each bug.
- Add all necessary information and examples in a dedicated directory:
  - A code file or project containing an MRE (minimal reproducible example).
  - A separate code file or project providing a solution or workaround for the issue.
  - A readme containing:
    - A brief description of the problem.
    - Details about the environment where the issue occurs.
    - A short explanation of how to resolve it.
    - A demonstration of the issue (video / screenshot / GIF).
- Add a link to your contribution in the main README.md.

## If You Prefer Not to Submit a Pull Request


You can create a GitHub Issue with the following:
- A description of the problem.

Weâ€™ll take care of turning it into a project with an example.
