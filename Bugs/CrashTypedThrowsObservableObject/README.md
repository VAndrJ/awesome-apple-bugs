## Problem


Crash occurs when using a typed throws in a closure variable within an `ObservableObject`.


## Environment


- Xcode 16.0-16.2 (current; check on future versions).
- iOS ...-17.x.
- iPadOS ...-17.x.
- watchOS ...-10.x.
- visionOS ...-1.x.
- macOS (not tested).
- Swift 5/6.


## Solution / Workaround


Do not use typed throws.


## Demo


Video showing how it works up to but not including iOS 18.0.
