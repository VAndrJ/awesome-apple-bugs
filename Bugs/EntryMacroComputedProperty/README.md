## Problem


Entry macro issue: generated variable `defaultValue` is computed property if variable type is explicitly specified.


## Environment


- Xcode 16.0, 16.1.
- Swift 5/6.


## Solution / Workaround


Update Xcode to version 16.2 or newer.


## Demo

## Additions


It's good that this is a macro and when building in a new version of Xcode, this bug will be fixed for all supported versions.
