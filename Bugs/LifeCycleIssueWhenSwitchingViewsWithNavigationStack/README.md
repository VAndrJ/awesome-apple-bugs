## Problem


Lifecycle issue: `onAppear`, `onDisappear`, `task` are called again when the `NavigationStack` with a View is replaced by another View.

- Xcode 16.0-16.3 (current; check on future versions).
- iOS 18.0-18.4 (current; check on future versions).
- iPadOS 18.0-18.4 (current; check on future versions).
- Swift 5/6.
