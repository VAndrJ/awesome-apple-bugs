## Problem


Sheet issue: `.presentationDetents` is ignored if the sheet is reopened after a short period.


## Environment


- Xcode 16.0-16.2 (current; check on future versions).
- iOS 18.0-18.3 (current; check on future versions).
- Swift 5/6.


## Solution / Workaround


Allow `.sheet` to be presented again only after a short delay.
